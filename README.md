# Credit – Advanced Loan Modeling & Personal Finance Decision Engine

## Overview
CreditCraft is a full-stack web application that helps users make smarter decisions about loans and personal finance. It allows users to explore and compare different loan options, understand their Equated Monthly Installments (EMI), and see how their repayments evolve over time through interactive visualizations.

## What CreditCraft Does
- **Supports Multiple Loan Types**  
  Work with common loan categories such as education, car, and home loans, with the flexibility to extend to additional products in the future.

- **Loan Scenario Modeling**  
  Configure loan amount, interest rate, and tenure to calculate EMIs, total interest paid, and overall repayment. Experiment with different scenarios to see how small changes affect long-term cost.

- **Refinancing Analysis**  
  Compare original and refinanced loan scenarios side by side. Visualize potential savings, shorter tenures, or reduced EMIs to understand the real impact of refinancing decisions.

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  View amortization schedules and key metrics through dynamic charts and dashboards. Track principal vs. interest over time and get a clear breakdown of monthly payments.

- **Responsive, User-Friendly UI**  
  Access the application from desktop, tablet, or mobile with a layout optimized for clarity and ease of use. Inputs and results are presented in an intuitive, finance-friendly format.

- **Secure User Accounts**  
  Users can create and manage personal profiles, save loan scenarios, and revisit previous analyses. Authentication is handled using secure, token-based mechanisms to keep financial data protected.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React-based single-page application for a responsive and interactive user experience.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express providing REST APIs for loan calculations, simulations, and user management.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent storage of user profiles, loan configurations, and historical simulations.

## Development & Roadmap
CreditCraft is under active development. Current work focuses on:
1. Stabilizing core loan and refinancing calculation APIs.
2. Enhancing the dashboard with richer charts and comparison tools.
3. Improving performance and responsiveness across devices.

Planned enhancements include:
- Integration with external services for real-time interest rate data.
- More advanced recommendation logic for personal finance decisions.
- Additional loan products and custom repayment options (e.g., part-prepayments, step-up EMIs).
